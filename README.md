## WARNING
To use an iCloud account, you need an invalid SMBIOS. Generate yours using the GenSMBIOS tool and add it to the config.plist file (edit using ProperTree).
Refer to the [Post-Install OpenCore guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html) for more info.

If you are using a different motherboard (or a PC case without front IO), you will likely have to remap your USB ports.
